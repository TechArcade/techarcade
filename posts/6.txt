# Mafia 1: The Original is Better than the Remake

--Games--


Mafia 1 is widely regarded as one of the best open-world games of all time. It captivated gamers with its stunning visuals, excellent storytelling, and compelling gameplay. In 2020, a remake of the game was released with improved graphics and other features, but it failed to live up to the hype. Here are some reasons why Mafia 1: The Original is better than the remake.

## More Content and Better Story

One of the major criticisms of the Mafia remake is that it is missing a lot of content that made the original a fan-favorite. The side missions, character arcs of Tommy, background music, and better AI, among other things, are absent from the new game. This lack of content makes the game feel incomplete, and the overall story is worse for it.

The non-linear gameplay of the original is also something that the remake could not match. Every mission in the original had a unique feel to it, not just in its setting but also in how you approached the combat and the driving. The cover-based gameplay of the remake feels formulaic and lacks the variety and depth of the original.

## Better Controls and Progression

The controls in the original Mafia are better, and the cars and guns feel more realistic and impactful. The heavy and old cars of the original make driving feel more authentic, and the guns pack a real punch. The progression of cars is also better in the original, where you slowly unlock better vehicles as you move up.

## More Fleshed Out Characters

While some characters are more fleshed out in the remake, others are reduced to being morons or insignificant. The difference between how your boss and the rival boss do business in the original is lost in the remake, and the game fails to give you the feeling of being part of the Cosa Nostra. In the original, there were also funny moments despite the serious tone, which have been removed in the remake.

## More Choices and Immersive Navigation

In the original, some missions offer you the opportunity to handle things in different ways, adding to the game's replay value. The navigation system in the original also adds to the game's immersion. You can learn the shortcuts and turns in the city, making you feel like you are a part of the world.

## Conclusion

The original Mafia game was groundbreaking and provided an excellent alternative to the GTA series. It was a game that captured the hearts and minds of gamers around the world. While the remake had improved graphics and other features, it failed to live up to the hype. The lack of content, non-linear gameplay, and poorer controls, among other things, make the original Mafia a better game than the remake. It's a game that stands the test of time and is still enjoyable to play today.
