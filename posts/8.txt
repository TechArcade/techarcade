# In-Depth Review: Ironsight - A Well-Done Call of Duty Clone

--Games--

As a first-person shooter game, Ironsight has been on the market for a few years now. I've spent over 100 hours playing the game and have come to the conclusion that it's a well-done Call of Duty clone.

The game's graphics are impressive, and the variety of weapons and attachments available are outstanding. You can customize your loadout to your heart's content, giving you a unique and personalized gaming experience. The good thing is, it's not a pay-to-win game, which means you don't have to shell out money to get ahead.

Moreover, Ironsight provides a lot of free skins, which can be unlocked through gameplay, so you don't have to spend money to get cool skins for your weapons. The game has good servers in each continent, which means players from different regions can enjoy the game without experiencing lag.

However, the game has some annoying issues, one of which is the drop shot mechanic imported from Call of Duty. It's frustrating to encounter players who constantly drop to the ground while shooting, making it difficult to kill them. Additionally, there's a trending issue of keeping weapons accurate even when jumping, which takes away from the realism of the game.

While Ironsight has many unique features, one of its significant drawbacks is the absence of the Iron Vision system. It was initially introduced to help players spot enemies in dark areas, but it was eventually removed from the game. Its absence can make it challenging to identify opponents in poorly lit areas, affecting the gameplay experience.

In conclusion, Ironsight is a good first-person shooter game, and its similarities to Call of Duty make it easy to pick up and play. It has many different weapons and attachments, good graphics, and it's not pay to win. It's a great game for players who love FPS games, but the annoying ability and trending issues can be frustrating at times. The removal of the Iron Vision system has also been a significant downside, but overall, Ironsight is a game worth trying out.
