# Another game franchise bites the dust

--Games--

Well, well, well. Another game franchise bites the dust. The Saints Row Reboot is a prime example of how identity politics and political correctness can destroy a once-great franchise. The game now has three insufferable tree protagonists that seem to be more concerned with checking all the diversity boxes rather than actually being interesting or enjoyable characters.

The original Saints Row games were known for their outrageous and offensive content, which is what made them so beloved by fans. However, the Saints Row Reboot has gone in the opposite direction, trying to be more inclusive and diverse at the expense of creativity and quality. The game is filled with politically correct messages and themes, such as feminism and anti-racism, which are forced down the player's throat at every turn.

What's worse is that the game seems to be more focused on pandering to a certain group of people rather than creating an enjoyable experience for everyone. The three main characters are all part of different marginalized groups, but they are also incredibly bland and uninteresting. It seems like the developers were more concerned with checking off the diversity boxes than creating compelling characters that players would actually care about.

The Saints Row Reboot has been criticized for its lack of creativity and focus on identity politics, which has led to a game that is more concerned with being politically correct than being fun. Fans of the franchise are disappointed by the lack of offensive and outrageous content that made the original games so enjoyable. It remains to be seen whether the franchise can recover from this misstep, but it is clear that identity politics has once again destroyed another beloved game franchise.

Many fans of the franchise were disappointed with the direction the series had taken and were hoping for a return to the more grounded and gritty gameplay of the first two games. However, what they got was a game filled with over-the-top humor and political messaging that felt forced and out of place.

One of the major issues with the Saints Row reboot was the introduction of three new protagonists who were insufferable and unlikable. Unlike the previous games, which had a single protagonist, the reboot attempted to diversify the cast by including a Black woman, a Latinx man, and a non-binary character. While this might seem like a step in the right direction for representation, the execution left a lot to be desired.

The characters were not only poorly written, but they were also heavily influenced by identity politics. The Black woman, Neenah, was portrayed as angry and aggressive, while the Latinx man, Kevin, was a stereotypical gangster. The non-binary character, Eli, was defined solely by their gender identity and lacked any real personality.

This over-reliance on identity politics not only resulted in poorly developed characters but also detracted from the overall gameplay experience. The focus on representation and diversity came at the expense of actual storytelling and character development, leaving players feeling disconnected from the game's world and its characters.

Moreover, the game's political messaging was heavy-handed and didactic, with the developers seemingly more interested in pushing their agenda than creating an engaging and immersive game. This approach not only turned off many fans but also failed to resonate with those who were sympathetic to the game's message.

In conclusion, the Saints Row reboot was a disappointing entry in the franchise that failed to live up to its predecessors. The heavy-handed approach to identity politics, insufferable protagonists, and lackluster storytelling all contributed to a game that felt disjointed and out of touch with its fan base. It's a cautionary tale for developers who prioritize politics over gameplay and risk alienating their audience in the process.
