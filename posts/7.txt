# The Dawn Fall of Battle Royale Games: What Went Wrong with Apex Legends and PUBG

--Games--

In recent years, the popularity of battle royale games has soared, with titles like Apex Legends and PUBG dominating the gaming world. However, as time has passed, the popularity of these games has waned, and many players have found them unplayable and unenjoyable. In this article, we'll explore some of the characteristics that have contributed to the downfall of battle royale games.

One of the primary issues with battle royale games is their repetitive nature. While the basic concept of the game is exciting - drop onto an island, scavenge for weapons, and be the last player standing - the reality is that the gameplay quickly becomes stale. Players quickly learn the most effective strategies and the most common locations for finding loot, and the game becomes a monotonous routine of dropping into the same spots and using the same tactics.

Another issue with battle royale games is their reliance on chance. Players can drop into a location and find no weapons or armor, putting them at a significant disadvantage. Conversely, players can also drop into a location and find powerful weapons and armor, giving them a significant advantage. This element of chance means that some players will have an easier time than others, and luck can play a more significant role than skill.

Furthermore, the longevity of battle royale games is limited by their lack of progression. While other genres, like RPGs and MMOs, offer players a sense of progression through leveling up, earning new gear, and unlocking new abilities, battle royale games lack this element. Players start each match with nothing and end each match with nothing, which can become demotivating over time.

Another factor that has contributed to the downfall of battle royale games is the lack of updates and changes to the gameplay. Players crave new content, new maps, and new challenges to keep the game fresh and exciting. However, many battle royale games have failed to deliver on these fronts, resulting in a stale and uninteresting gameplay experience.

Finally, many battle royale games have been plagued by issues with cheating and hacking. Players who use cheats and hacks to gain an unfair advantage ruin the gameplay experience for everyone else. This issue can make the game feel unfair and unplayable, and it has caused many players to abandon these games altogether.

In conclusion, the downfall of battle royale games like Apex Legends and PUBG can be attributed to a variety of factors, including repetitive gameplay, reliance on chance, lack of progression, lack of updates, and issues with cheating and hacking. While battle royale games were once incredibly popular, their decline serves as a cautionary tale for game developers and players alike. It's clear that in order for a game to maintain its popularity and success, it must offer something new, fresh, and exciting to keep players engaged.
