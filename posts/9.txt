Postal 2: An Underrated Masterpiece on the Philosophy of Choices and the Parallel of Violence in Virtual and Real Worlds

Postal 2 is a game that has received little attention despite its unique approach to gameplay and its philosophical commentary on choices and the effects of violence in both virtual and real worlds. The game was released in 2003 by Running with Scissors and is a first-person shooter that is not afraid to tackle controversial themes and subjects.

The game is centered around the life of the Postal Dude, an unnamed protagonist, who is tasked with completing mundane tasks like buying milk and cashing a paycheck while dealing with the chaotic world around him. The player is given the choice to complete the tasks peacefully or to engage in violent behavior and wreak havoc on the world around them.

The game's commentary on choices is a profound one, as it forces players to confront the consequences of their actions. Each choice has an impact on the world around the player, and as the game progresses, the player must live with the consequences of their actions, be they positive or negative. The game forces the player to confront the morality of their choices and the effects that those choices have on the world around them.

In addition to its commentary on choices, Postal 2 also delves into the parallel of violence in virtual and real worlds. The game is known for its extreme violence and controversial themes, and some have criticized it for promoting violence. However, the game's violence is not gratuitous or mindless. Instead, it serves to highlight the disturbing nature of violence in both virtual and real worlds.

The game's violence is juxtaposed with the mundanity of everyday tasks, forcing the player to confront the absurdity of violence in a world where peace and normalcy should reign. The violence in Postal 2 is not something to be celebrated or glorified but rather something to be understood and condemned.

The game's approach to violence and its commentary on choices make it an underrated masterpiece that deserves more attention. It is a game that forces players to confront difficult questions and to examine their own morality. It is a game that challenges the notion of violence in both virtual and real worlds and serves as a warning against the consequences of violence.

In conclusion, Postal 2 is an underrated masterpiece that should be recognized for its philosophical commentary on choices and the effects of violence in both virtual and real worlds. It is a game that challenges players to confront difficult questions and to examine their own morality. It serves as a warning against the consequences of violence and is a reminder that choices have consequences.
