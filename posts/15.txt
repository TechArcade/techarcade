--Games--

Games are in danger, and this is a reality that is not yet as widely publicized as other media, such as movies and paintings. While many people enjoy and play video games regularly, most are not aware of the challenges that game preservation faces. In this article, we will explore the reasons why games are in danger and why this is an important issue.

First and foremost, it is important to understand that games are a relatively new form of media. Although the history of video games dates back to the 1950s, commercial games only began to emerge in the 1970s. As a result, many old games were created on platforms that are now obsolete, making it difficult to play them on modern devices. The lack of compatibility with modern platforms is a major challenge for game preservation, as players may lose access to old games when supporting devices and technologies become obsolete.

Another reason why games are in danger is that they rely on online servers to function properly. Many modern games require players to be connected to the internet to play, which means that these games cannot be played if the server is shut down. This has already happened with many online games that have been closed, making it impossible for players to access them again.

There are many popular online games that are no longer available to play for various reasons, such as server shutdowns, termination of licensing agreements, and discontinuation of support. Here are 20 examples of online games that can no longer be played:

- Club Penguin
- City of Heroes
- Star Wars Galaxies
- Matrix Online
- Marvel Heroes
- WildStar
- Warhammer Online
- APB Reloaded
- The Secret World
- Tabula Rasa
- LawBreakers
- Paragon
- Gigantic
- Dawngate
- Nosgoth
- Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - First Assault Online
- Law & Order: Legacies
- CSI: Fatal Conspiracy
- Age of Empires Online
- Disney Infinity

These are just a few examples of online games that have been deactivated and are no longer available to play. Unfortunately, many other online games are also at risk of being lost in the future, highlighting the importance of game preservation to ensure that the history of games can be appreciated by future generations.

Furthermore, games also face challenges related to copyright and licensing. When a game is discontinued, copyright can make it difficult or impossible for other companies or individuals to preserve the game or make changes to make it compatible with modern platforms. This can lead to the loss of entire games and make game preservation more challenging.

In addition to these challenges, there are initiatives to preserve the history of games. Game museums, online archives, and game preservation projects are working to ensure that old games can be played and studied by future generations. However, these initiatives often face a lack of funding and public support compared to other media.

The recent lawsuit against the Online Archive by book publishers once again demonstrates how copyright can be a barrier to preservation and access to information. The Online Archive is a nonprofit organization that provides free access to a wide range of digital materials, including books, newspaper and magazine articles, games, films, and music. However, book publishers argue that the organization is infringing on their copyrights and are demanding significant financial compensation. This case exemplifies how copyright can be used as a weapon by large corporations to maintain control and limit access to information.

Copyright, or intellectual property rights, is a system that grants creators the exclusive right to control the distribution and use of their works. Although the intention of copyright is to protect the rights of creators, its implementation often favors large corporations and lobbyists at the expense of the general public.

Copyright is often used to create artificial monopolies, preventing competition and hindering innovation. Large corporations often use copyright to protect their intellectual properties and secure a dominant position in the market. This is particularly problematic in the entertainment industry, where big companies control a significant portion of film, music, and game production and distribution. As a result, we often see creative products with inflated prices and a lack of variety as smaller and independent companies are hindered from competing with the major corporations.

Furthermore, copyright is also frequently used to control access to information and culture. Libraries, archives, and other content providers often face legal and financial restrictions that hinder the dissemination of information and knowledge. This is particularly problematic in developing countries where access to critical information can be restricted by copyright.

However, the most severe example of the negative impact of copyright can be seen in the pharmaceutical industry. Many pharmaceutical companies hold exclusive patents on essential drugs, preventing other companies from producing cheaper generic versions. This means that many people in developing countries do not have access to life-saving medications. A notable example of this is the AIDS crisis in Africa, where millions of people did not have access to treatment due to the exclusive patents held by pharmaceutical companies.

This situation can lead to the death of thousands of people, as the lack of access to essential medications can be fatal. Additionally, the lack of competition in the pharmaceutical market can also lead to inflated prices for medications, further harming those who need them the most.

Copyright has a significant negative impact on the preservation of old and rare games. Due to the restrictions imposed by copyright, many games are no longer commercially available and become inaccessible to the general public. This can be problematic for those interested in preserving the history of games as many old titles are lost and become impossible to play again.

Game preservation is important for understanding the evolution of the gaming industry and gamer culture. However, due to copyright restrictions, many old games are at risk of being lost. Companies often have no interest in keeping old games in the market as they no longer generate profit, leading to games becoming inaccessible or even being deleted.

Piracy is often seen as an alternative for the preservation of old and rare games. Many players resort to piracy to access games that are no longer commercially available. It is often the only way to preserve old games that would otherwise be lost.

When a law is unjust, we should not obey it. This can be applied to copyright, as intellectual property is not a scarce resource, and the enforcement of copyright harms creativity and the preservation of culture. In this sense, piracy is an alternative to preserving old games that are no longer available.

In conclusion, games are in danger, and this is an important issue that needs to be discussed. While games have become a popular form of entertainment, preserving the history of games faces many challenges, including platform obsolescence, dependence on online servers, and copyright issues. It is important for the public and the game industry to recognize the importance of game preservation and support initiatives to ensure that old games can be played and studied in the future.
