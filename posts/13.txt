# Is bood the best game of the 90s?

--Games--

In the 90s, the first-person shooter genre was dominated by classics like Doom and Quake. But there was one game that stood out from the rest, a game that pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the genre. That game was Blood, and it remains one of the best FPS games of the 90s.

Released in 1997 by Monolith Productions, Blood is a game that embraced the horror genre with open arms. Set in the early 20th century, players assume the role of Caleb, a former cultist seeking revenge against his former leader. The game's story is dark and atmospheric, with Lovecraftian influences and plenty of references to classic horror movies.

But what truly sets Blood apart from other FPS games of the era is its gameplay. The game is built on the same engine as Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior, but it takes the mechanics to new heights. The levels are filled with hidden areas and secrets to uncover, and the weapons are inventive and satisfying to use. The game's signature weapon, the pitchfork, is a testament to the game's creativity.

But perhaps the most significant innovation in Blood was the introduction of verticality to the FPS genre. The game's levels are filled with multiple floors, and players are encouraged to explore every nook and cranny. It's a mechanic that would later be refined in games like Half-Life and Deus Ex, but Blood was the first game to truly embrace it.

The game's AI was also impressive for its time. Enemies would dodge and weave to avoid player attacks, and they were smart enough to take cover and use the environment to their advantage. It was a marked improvement over the mindless enemies found in other FPS games of the era.

And let's not forget about the game's multiplayer mode. Blood's multiplayer was a blast to play, with a variety of game modes and plenty of weapons to choose from. It was a precursor to the online multiplayer games that dominate the FPS genre today.

Unfortunately, Blood was never as successful as other FPS games of the era. It was overshadowed by games like Quake II and Half-Life, and the game's controversial content (including graphic violence and religious imagery) led to it being banned in several countries. But for those who played it, Blood was a revelation.

In conclusion, Blood is one of the best FPS games of the 90s, and it remains a classic to this day. The game's innovative mechanics, verticality, and impressive AI set it apart from other games of the era. Its horror-inspired story and inventive weapons make it a must-play for fans of the genre. If you're looking for a game that pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the FPS genre, look no further than Blood.
