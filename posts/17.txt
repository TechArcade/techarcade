# Team Fortress 2, an abandoned game full of fans

--Games--

Team Fortress 2 is a first-person shooter game that was released in October 2007. But to understand the history of TF2, we need to go back a little in time. The Team Fortress series started as a mod for Quake in 1996, created by a group of students from the University of Waterloo in Canada. The mod became popular and caught the attention of Valve Corporation, who invited the team to work on an official sequel, called Team Fortress Classic.

Released in 1999, Team Fortress Classic was a success, with players praising its fast gameplay, unique character classes, and multiplayer game mode. The game was also one of the first to feature class-based gameplay, where players choose from a variety of characters with unique abilities and weapons.

However, Valve felt that there was plenty of room for improvement and decided to work on a new sequel, Team Fortress 2. Development of the game began in 1998, but Valve had trouble finding a direction for the game. The game went through several iterations and experiments, with the team trying to find the right gameplay and a visual style that fit the overall vision of the game.

The development of TF2 was put on hold for a while when Valve decided to focus on other projects, such as Half-Life 2 and Portal. But in 2006, the team returned to working on the game and decided to adopt a more cartoonish visual style, which contrasted with the realistic graphics of the time. The style was inspired by cartoons from the 1950s and 1960s, and the team wanted the game to be fun and accessible to players of all ages.

The game was finally released in October 2007, as part of Valve's Orange Box package, which also included Half-Life 2, Portal, and other games. The game was well-received by critics and players, with praise especially for its unique visual style and enjoyable gameplay.

One of the most notable aspects of TF2 is its nine playable characters, each with unique abilities and personalities. The Heavy is a huge Russian with a minigun, the Scout is a fast and agile teenager, the Pyro is a psychopath wielding a flamethrower, and so on. Each character has a unique set of weapons and abilities that can be customized with items found in the game or acquired through trading with other players.

TF2 also features a variety of game modes, from classic capture the flag to the popular Mann vs. Machine mode, where players work together to defend a base against invading robots. The game is primarily played online, with players from around the world competing in multiplayer matches.

In summary, Team Fortress 2 is a beloved first-person shooter game with a rich history. Despite its developers not actively updating the game for a long time, it still maintains an active and engaged community. The game's unique gameplay, memorable characters, and diverse game modes contribute to its enduring popularity.
